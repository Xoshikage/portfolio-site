This is my portfolio resume website. I published this website on Janurary 12th, 2026.

index.html and style.css were written by me and extended by VS code's built in Claude AI. All other files are configurations needed to run tailwind. This includes:
- launch.json, settings.json
- output.css (A preliminary that translates the tailwind in style.css to traditional css)
- postcss.config.js
- assets and assets/images contain resources for the images, favicon, video, etc.

- Suggestions were made by Google's Gemini In Browser AI, that was able to view my website and make suggestions based off what it saw.

Specific components created by Claude AI:
- index.html: Nobile Menu Toggle Script (Line 220 - 236)
- style.css:  .nav-link, .grow-on-hover, and .text-glow components
- style.css:  Mobile Responsive Improvement Component (Line 110 - 119)
